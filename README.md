# CastleBuster
First game project I created in high school

This is the first computer science project I worked on in my highschool computer science class.  Being my first project at the time it is quite simple and not that well made and has some bugs in it.  All of the images used for the game were not created by me. 

Controls: 
  Left arrow key: move left
  Rigth arrow key: move right 
  Up arrow key: jump
  F: fire arrow
  
  
Objective:
  Reach the end of the levels by killing enemies and breaking down their castle
